# coursera-python
These are mini projects that I completed for Rice University's "Interactive Programming in Python" at Coursera between SEP 2015 and OCT 2015.
The codes can be effectively run on [CodeSkulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org/) built by [Scott Rixner](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~rixner/), one of the instructors of the course.
